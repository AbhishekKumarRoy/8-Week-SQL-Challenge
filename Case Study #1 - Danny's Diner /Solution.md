SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(points) AS points
FROM sales s
JOIN points_table p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```
#### Output
| customer_id | points |
|-------------|--------|
| A           |    860 |

### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi. How many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
```sql

      )
   ) AS total_points
FROM sales s
JOIN members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
JOIN menu me ON s.product_id = me.product_id
WHERE MONTH(s.order_date) = 1
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```
#### Output
| customer_id | total_points |
|-------------|--------------|
| B           |          820 |
